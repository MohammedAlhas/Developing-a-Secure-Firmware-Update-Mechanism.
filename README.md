## Project Overview

The firmware update mechanism is designed to ensure secure updates to IoT devices, leveraging cryptographic techniques to verify the authenticity and integrity of firmware updates. The system consists of a user interface for interacting with the firmware manager and a secure server that hosts the firmware.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](architecture_diagram.png)

The architecture includes:
- **Firmware Update Manager**: The main interface for users to manage firmware updates.
- **Secure HTTPS Server**: Hosts firmware and handles secure communications.
- **Cryptographic Components**: For code signing and verification.

## Directory Structure

## Scripts and Functionality

### update_terminal_ui.py

This script serves as the user interface for managing firmware updates. It allows users to:

1. Check for updates.
2. Download firmware.
3. Verify firmware.
4. Apply firmware updates.
5. Execute all actions in sequence.

### verify_update.py

This script verifies the firmware's signature using OpenSSL. It checks whether the firmware has been signed correctly with the corresponding private key.

### secure_https_server.py

This script sets up a secure HTTPS server that hosts the firmware files. It ensures encrypted communication between the IoT devices and the server.

### schedule_updates.py

This script provides functionality for scheduling automated firmware updates. It ensures devices stay updated without manual intervention.

## Cryptographic Implementation

The firmware update mechanism employs cryptographic techniques for secure code signing and verification:

- **Code Signing**: Each firmware file is signed with a private key, creating a signature file.
- **Verification**: The public key is used to verify the signature of the firmware before applying updates.

## Setup Guide

### Setting Up the TLS Secure Update Server

1. **Generate SSL Certificates**: 
   - Use the following command to generate a private key and certificate:
     ```bash
     openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
     ```

2. **Run the Secure HTTPS Server**: 
   - Start the server using the command:
     ```bash
     python3 secure_https_server.py
     ```
   - Ensure that the server listens on port 4443 (or as specified in `config.yaml`).

### Running the Firmware Update Manager

1. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - Make sure you have `requests` installed:
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

2. **Run the Firmware Update Manager**:
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python3 update_terminal_ui.py
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to manage firmware updates.

## Testing and Validation Documentation

### Test Plans

1. **Firmware Verification**: 
   - Test the verification of the firmware by downloading and verifying with both correct and incorrect signatures.

2. **Update Application**: 
   - Test the application of the firmware to ensure it integrates without issues.

3. **Failure Recovery**: 
   - Simulate failures during the update process and validate the recovery mechanism.

## User Authentication and Access Control

The update manager implements a simple username and password authentication mechanism:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password123`

Best practices for managing user permissions include:
- Limiting access to the firmware update manager to authorized personnel.
- Logging all update activities for audit purposes.

## Conclusion

This secure firmware update mechanism is designed to ensure the safety and integrity of IoT device updates. By implementing cryptographic verification and a secure server, this system significantly mitigates risks associated with unauthorized firmware modifications.
